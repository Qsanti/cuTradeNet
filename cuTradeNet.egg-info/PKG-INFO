# cuTradeNet

**cuTradeNet** is a library that provides classes to easily run *kinetic wealth exchange models* on *complex networks*. 

It is written in Python and uses Cuda module form the Numba package to accelerate the simulation runnin in the GPU. It's completely abstracted from the CUDA knowledge, so you can use it as a regular Python library.
