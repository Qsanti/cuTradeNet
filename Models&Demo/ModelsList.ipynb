    " [*Kinetic wealth exchange models*](https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/elementary-kinetic-exchange-models/ \"online mini simulations\") provide a description of wealth flow in terms of stochastic wealth exchange between agents, resembling the energy transfer between the molecules of a fluid.

    "They are made of $N$ economic [agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model), with a total wealth $W_{total}$, and perform pair conservative exchanges. At each time steps of simulations each agent $i$ exchanges a quantity $\\Delta \\omega_{ij}$ with another agent $j$ chosen randomly. The exchange is conservative, meaning that the total wealth of the system is conserved. The exchange is also pair, meaning that the exchange is between two agents, and not between an agent and the environment.\n",

The exchanges are performed in a [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) fashion, where the next exchange is independent of the previous one. Since a each time step each agent chooses a random agent to exchange with, each MCS consoists of $N$ exchanges.\n",

So each agent can *only* exchange with the agents connected to it. "
